# E8408_Hiking_Tour_Assistant

Hiking Tour Assistant
**Overview**
Miniproject from the ELEC-E8408 course, Aalto University.
Hiking Tour Assistant is a wearable Arduino-based system designed to track hiking sessions. A smart wristband collects real-time activity data and transmits step and distance data via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to an Arduino, ensuring seamless synchronization.



**System Components**
1.  Smartwatch 
* Tracks user activity (steps, distance).
* Stores session data until synced with the Arduino.
* Uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for communication.
* Sends data in a structured format for processing.
2. Arduino 
* Bluetooth connection with the wristband.
* Receives and processes hiking session data.
* Sends acknowledgment (r) upon successful data reception.
* 
**Supported hardware**
Arduino Mega
LCD Screen (16x2, I2C)
